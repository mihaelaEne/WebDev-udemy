    <p>
      The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a
      domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is
      derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the
      dog's nearest living relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be
      domesticated[9][8] by humans. Hunter-gatherers did this, over 15,000 years
      ago in Germany,[7] which was before the development of agriculture.[1] Due
      to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large
      number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a
      starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11] The dog
      has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory
      capabilities, and physical attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in
      shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as
      hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the
      military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the
      millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the
      humanâ€“canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.[13] This influence
      on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".[14]

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>
      n 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his
      Systema Naturae, the two-word naming of species (binomial nomenclature).
      Canis is the Latin word meaning "dog",[15] and under this genus, he listed
      the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal. He classified the
      domestic dog as Canis familiaris and, on the next page, classified the
      grey wolf as Canis lupus.[2] Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate
      species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata),
      which is not found in any other canid.[16]

    <h3>Biology</h3>
    <p>
      All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have an identical
      skeletal structure with the exception of the number of bones in the tail,
      although there is significant skeletal variation between dogs of different
      types.[26][27] The dog's skeleton is well adapted for running; the
      vertebrae on the neck and back have extensions for powerful back muscles
      to connect to, the long ribs provide plenty of room for the heart and
      lungs, and the shoulders are unattached to the skeleton allowing great
      flexibility.[26][27] Compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective
      breeding since domestication has seen the dog's skeleton greatly enhanced
      in size for larger types as mastiffs and miniaturised for smaller types
      such as terriers; dwarfism has been selectively utilised for some types
      where short legs are advantageous such as dachshunds and corgis.[27] Most
      dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with naturally
      short tails have as few as three.[26] The dog's skull has identical
      components regardless of breed type, but there is significant divergence
      in terms of skull shape between types.[27][28] The three basic skull
      shapes are the elongated dolichocephalic type as seen in sighthounds, the
      intermediate mesocephalic or mesaticephalic type, and the very short and
      broad brachycephalic type exemplified by mastiff type skulls.[27][28]
